The Devil is in the Edges: Monocular Depth Estimation with Edge-aware Consistency Fusion

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel monocular depth estimation method, named ECFNet, for estimating high-quality monocular depth with clear edges and valid overall structure from a single RGB image. We make a thorough inquiry about the key factor that affects the edge depth estimation of the MDE networks, and come to a ratiocination that the edge information itself plays a critical role in predicting depth details.
Driven by this analysis, we propose to explicitly employ the image edges as input for ECFNet and fuse the initial depths from different sources to produce the final depth.
